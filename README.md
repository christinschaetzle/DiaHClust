# diaHClust

DiaHClust is an R package which implements the DiaHClust methodology (Sch√§tzle and Booth 2019), 
    a new approach which can be used to identify stages in language change based on quantitative corpus-derived data. 
    DiaHClust is based on the hierarchical clustering approach for historical data from Hilpert and Gries (2008, 2012) 
    called 'Variability-based Neighbor Clustering' (VNC) and develops this further by adding an extra iterative approach 
    to the hierarchical clustering which results in a multi-layered perspective on change, from text-level to broader periods.
